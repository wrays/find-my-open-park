## <a name="project-concept"></a>Project Concept

* [Initial Detailed Find My Open Park Proposal](https://github.com/atxhack4change/2016-project-proposals/issues/27)

#### Problem This Project Addresses
Austin public parks and their amenities are sometimes less accessible or inaccessible due to special events, weather events, scheduled maintenance, construction, and other activities. Although information about some of the disruptions of normal use or closures appears on the City's web site, there is not a comprehensive one-stop source for Austin park users.

#### Project Goal
This project seeks to: 
* 1) aggregate data about special events, weather events, scheduled maintenance, construction, and other activities happening in and around Austin public parks,
* 2) combine that data with information about park amenities and regular hours of operation, and
* 3) create a map-based tool to explore this data and information on both desktop and mobile platforms. 

## <a name="use-cases"></a>Use Cases

* 1) I want to ride my bike at my favorite park, but it's a Saturday. Are there any events or closures I should know about before I go?
* 2) I am at my new friend's house and we want to go on a hike. What parks are near us with good traits?
* 3) I'm at the park and something is broken. I want to let people know.

## <a name="park-data"></a>Austin Park Information and Data

During the ATX Hack 4 Change the big focus was on collecting and analyzing the available data, which is aggregated here:

- [Google Sheet with 20+ Datasets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J2tBClNQks7oTdFGzAOQ8yg6GJzo6Y8ixtoFVFl9kq4/edit#gid=0)
