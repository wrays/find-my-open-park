Austin has 277 public parks that sometimes are inaccessible. This project seeks to make park closure information more transparent.

## What is your project concept or idea? What challenge or opportunity will it solve?

Have you ever had your plans to enjoy a beautiful day in the park thwarted because the park you intended to visit was being used for a paid event, the trails were closed due to recent flood damage, a new capital construction project was underway, or the roads to get there were blocked off because of a race?

Encountering these types of closures and obstacles to park access can dampen one's spirit and take the joy out of what promised to be a fun day. A problem is that there is not a comprehensive and central information source for park goers to easily learn about these situations.

A "Find My Open Park" tool would pull together such information from various sources and allow users to look up a park to check on park accessibility for that day. The look up feature would be operable by typing in the name of the park or clicking on a map.

A geolocation function would also allow mobile users to find park accessibility status for nearby parks if they were new Austinites or visitors not familiar with park names and locations.

## Who will benefit from your project? Describe the humans at the center of the problem - who are they?

This project will benefit any potential Austin park user, whether a first time visitor to our City or a long-time resident. It will especially benefit people who are less familiar with Austin parks and the activities that are scheduled in parks that sometimes limit access and/or use.

There are 277 City-owned parks spread throughout Austin, including 11 Metro parks, 15 District parks, 43 Greenbelt parks, and 85 Neighborhood parks. Many of them rarely experience closures whereas some of them often experience scheduled events. When it floods trails in our Greenbelt parks may be closed.

The types of park users who would benefit are as varied as the types of resources available to them: cyclists, hikers, dog walkers, swimmers, disc golf players, picnickers, etc.

### How would they benefit? Can you tell their story?

Anyone who decides they want to enjoy park resources will be benefit because they will be able to make informed choices and decisions to plan their day in the park and potentially their routes to get there.

A park user will be able to use the "Find My Open Park" tool to determine whether a park or portions of a park are closed due to maintenance or repair, new construction, paid-only park events, bicycle or foot races, any other type of activity that would limit and restrict normal use, or simply the hours of operation.

It is even possible that this tool could be granular enough to show when park bathrooms are locked and unlocked - which could be especially useful real-time information to mobile users.

The City of Austin Parks and Recreation Department does have a page with information about closures. This project would build on that.

The "Find My Open Park" tool would also allow park goers to:

- Find nearest park to them that is open and accessible that day
- Search for parks by park features

### Do you have photos of them? Or quotes?

## Tell us about yourself. 

### What is your background? Why is this challenge important to you? 

**Background:**
- Resident of Austin for 21 years
- Avid park user for cycling, walking, and hiking
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanwray)

**Why important challenge?**

With Austin growing as fast as it is, with a finite space for urban parks, and with demand for use of that park space growing, it's important to have an improved system to help people have better information about when parks are available for use.

### Are you representing a group in submitting this project idea? 

No. I'm technically not representing a group when submitting this project. This project needs a group. 

I am the co-founder of a neighborhood group in Montopolis that secured funding to develop a natural surface trail but that is not connected to this. This project could potentially be linked to a group or have it be under a group's umbrella.
